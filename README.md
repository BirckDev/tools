"# tools" 

ytdownloader is a tool to download youtube videos. The download folder is hardcoded into the tool, so that folder needs to be created before downloading.

filecreator is a tool to create files in any size. Obviously one could use the 
windows command 'fsutil file createnew [filename] [length]' to do the same, but
that file would be filled with zeroes instead of random byes.
