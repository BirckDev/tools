"# tools" 

**ytdownloader** downloads youtube videos. The download folder is hardcoded into the tool, so that folder needs to be created before downloading.

**filecreator** creates files with random bytes in any size. Very practical for testing. Obviously one could use the 
windows command 'fsutil file createnew [filename] [length]' to do the same, but
that file would be filled with zeroes instead of random bytes.
